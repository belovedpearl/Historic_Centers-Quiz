#### Colour Scheme

---
   
   In line with the motive of the website, I have selected a shade of green **(Hex Value = #184E20)** and **White** to complement the green nature attribute that the site promotes.

   I have also used **RGB(230,32,65)** as an **accent** color to especially in places where the users attention are needed

--- 

## Accessibility



* Get a Quote section

 This is designed to give users quick quote based on the services they require. The price given will be a range and the user will be informed that its just to have an idea of what it takes to get such services as prices might vary depending on their preferred service providers.


* Services section
   
   This introduces the user to garden standard practices and easy access to its providers.
  
* Contact Us

   This is included to provide easy contact to the providers.

## Design Choices


* The design choice was dictated by my ability to use the knowledge gained from the first module of the course. While presenting challenges, it allowed me to achieve a further growth in understanding of the concepts taught better.

* From the start of the program, I aimed to design a website that covers in detail concepts taught in the module and more.

---

### Font

* Roboto
    * Evokes a clean and bold style which prompts its readers wanting to act.
* Archivo
    * I believe it complements and blends with Roboto font.

## Technology, Frameworks and Programs

---

### Languages
* HTML

* CSS

### Frameworks and Programs


* Balsamiq
    * Used to create wireframes to plan the project


* Github
    * To store written code


* Gitpod
    * The project was put together using Gitpod development environment. From here, I could commit and push all of my changes to Github throughout the project.

---

## Bugs

---
* Caption Image
    * I discovered the caption image was not properly placed on smaller screen, it was resolved by resizing and viewing it till I got a properly placed caption image.
* Materialize
    * Being guided by our experienced group members, we all learnt that Materialize works on a grid basis. This caused problems in trying to centre our text on the navigation bar, where originally we were going to have a sign up link. However, the bugs would have needed specific media queries to iron it out and that would have been better achieved at the start of the project, we took the creative choice to drop the sign up option and present our application as more of a tool.

---

## Deployment

---


* The project was deployed via Github Pages.

Steps I took to deplay my website;
  * Go to the repository for Green Space.
  * Click on the settings tab and locate the pages tab.
  * Select to deploy from main branch.
  * A few minutes later, after refreshing the page, my site was live for viewing.
